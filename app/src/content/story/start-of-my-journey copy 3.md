My first introduction into the world of tech was from my father who worked as a telecommunications engineer. He used to bring home circuit boxes and draw up plans for different relays, giving me little exercises to complete as he worked. Everything from understanding resistor color bands to logic gates.

I was fascinated by his work and enjoyed the many PC games we played together, Homeworld and X-wing in particular. This is when I began to explore how text adventures were created and the syntax of Batch script files functioned on Windows XP.'

One day, he surprised me with a Raspberry Pi kit and a book on Python programming. He said it was time for me to learn how to make my own games and applications. I was thrilled and eager to dive into the world of coding. He helped me set up the Pi and showed me how to use the terminal and the IDLE editor. He also gave me some challenges to test my skills, such as making a calculator, a text-based adventure game, and a simple GUI with Tkinter.

I loved every minute of it and spent hours tinkering with the code, debugging errors, and adding new features. I learned a lot from the book and online tutorials, but also from my father's guidance and feedback. He taught me how to write clean, readable, and efficient code, how to use functions, classes, and modules, how to document and comment my code, and how to use version control tools like Git.

He also encouraged me to share my projects with others and get feedback from online communities like Stack Overflow and Reddit. He said that programming was not only a skill but also an art and a passion, and that I should always strive to improve myself and learn new things.

He was right. Programming became my favorite hobby and my dream career. Thanks to him, I discovered the joy of creating something out of nothing, of solving problems with logic and creativity, of expressing myself through code. He inspired me to pursue a degree in computer science and to explore different fields of technology like web development, data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

He was not only my father but also my mentor, my friend, and my role model. He passed away last year after a long battle with cancer, but his legacy lives on in me and in the code I write. He was the one who introduced me to the world of tech, and I will always be grateful for that.


I met my best friend in high school, when we both joined the computer club. He was a genius at programming and making games, and I was fascinated by his work and enjoyed the many PC games we played together, Homeworld and X-wing in particular. This is when I began to explore how text adventures were created and the syntax of Batch script files functioned on Windows XP. I learned a lot from him and we had a lot of fun making our own stories and puzzles. He inspired me to pursue a career in game development and I'm grateful for his friendship.


My first introduction into the world of tech was from my father who worked as a telecommunications engineer. He used to bring home circuit boxes and draw up plans for different relays, giving me little exercises to complete as he worked. Everything from understanding resistor color bands to logic gates.

I was fascinated by how he could create complex systems out of simple components, and how he could troubleshoot any problem with his multimeter and soldering iron. He taught me the basics of electronics and programming, and encouraged me to explore my own ideas and projects. He was always supportive and proud of my achievements, no matter how small or silly they were.

Thanks to him, I developed a passion for technology that has stayed with me throughout my life. I followed his footsteps and became an engineer myself, working on cutting-edge innovations in the field of wireless communication. I owe him a lot for sparking my curiosity and inspiring me to pursue my dreams. He was not only my father, but also my mentor and friend.

I have always been fascinated by technology and how it works. My father was a telecommunications engineer who taught me a lot about circuits and electronics. He would bring home different devices and show me how they functioned, drawing diagrams and giving me challenges to solve. I learned how to read resistor codes, how to use logic gates, and how to build simple circuits. He sparked my curiosity and inspired me to pursue a career in technology.
